# **Player Re-Identification: Approach and Methodology**

### **1. Choice of Task**

I chose **Option 2: Re-Identification in a Single Feed**. This task directly addresses the common challenge of occlusion in player tracking. It allows for the implementation of a sophisticated tracking algorithm that combines both motion and appearance cues, which is a core competency in sports AI. While Option 1 is an interesting problem, it adds the significant complexity of cross-camera feature matching, which is often intractable without camera geometric information (homography). Focusing on a robust single-camera solution is a more practical and effective use of the assignment's timeframe.

### **2. Methodology and Approach**

My approach follows the **tracking-by-detection** paradigm, which can be broken down into four key components:

**a. Player Detection**
For each frame of the video, I use the provided fine-tuned YOLOv11 model to detect all players. The model outputs a set of bounding boxes for each frame. Only detections with a confidence score above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5) are considered for tracking.

**b. Motion-Based Tracking (Kalman Filter)**
To handle frame-to-frame association, I use a **Kalman Filter** for each tracked player. A Kalman Filter is a linear state-space model that excels at predicting an object's future location based on its past positions.

* **State:** The state for each player is defined as $[x, y, a, h, v_x, v_y, v_a, v_h]$, representing the bounding box's center coordinates, aspect ratio, height, and their respective velocities.
* **Predict:** Before processing a new frame, the Kalman Filter predicts the next state for every active track.
* **Update:** The predicted state is then updated using the newly detected bounding box that matches the track.

**c. Appearance-Based Re-Identification (Deep Embeddings)**
The Kalman Filter fails when a player is occluded for a long time or moves unpredictably. To solve this (the core of re-identification), I generate an **appearance embedding** for each player.

* **Feature Extractor:** I use a pre-trained **ResNet50** model (trained on an image classification task like ImageNet) as a feature extractor. The player's image, cropped from the frame using their bounding box, is passed through the network, and the output from one of the final layers is used as a feature vector (embedding). This vector is a compact, numerical representation of the player's appearance (jersey color, skin tone, etc.).
* **Embedding Gallery:** For each tracked player, I maintain a small gallery of their most recent appearance embeddings to account for changes in pose and lighting.



**d. The Matching Cascade**
To associate detections with tracks, I employ a hierarchical matching strategy:

1.  **High-Confidence, Motion-Based Matching:**
    * First, I try to match active tracks with new detections that are very close to their Kalman Filter predictions. I use the **Hungarian algorithm** (`scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`) on an IoU (Intersection over Union) cost matrix for this initial, high-confidence matching.

2.  **Appearance-Based Re-Identification:**
    * Tracks that were not matched in the first step (i.e., they are potentially re-appearing after occlusion) and detections that were not assigned to any track are then matched based on appearance.
    * A **cosine similarity** cost matrix is computed between the embeddings of unmatched detections and the stored embeddings of "lost" tracks.
    * If the similarity is above a high threshold (e.g., 0.85), the track is revived with its old ID. This is the re-identification step.

3.  **Initialization of New Tracks:**
    * Any detections that remain unmatched after both motion and appearance checks are considered new players. A new track is initialized for each, with a new unique ID, a fresh Kalman Filter, and a newly computed appearance embedding.

4.  **Termination of Old Tracks:**
    * Tracks that remain un-matched for a specified number of frames (`max_age`) are considered to have left the scene and are deleted.

### **3. Challenges Encountered (Anticipated)**

* **Similar Uniforms:** Player jerseys might have very similar colors, making appearance embeddings less discriminative. Averaging embeddings over time helps mitigate this.
* **Motion Blur & Low Resolution:** Fast-moving players can appear blurry, degrading the quality of both the detection and the appearance features.
* **Computational Cost:** Running the YOLO detector and a deep feature extractor on every player in every frame can be slow. For a real-time system, optimizations like using a more lightweight feature extractor (e.g., MobileNetV2) or applying the feature extractor less frequently would be necessary.

### **4. Potential Improvements**

* **Train a Custom Re-ID Model:** Instead of using a generic ResNet model, fine-tuning a dedicated Re-ID network on a sports-specific dataset would yield much more discriminative appearance features.
* **More Advanced Tracker:** Algorithms like **ByteTrack** could be integrated. ByteTrack has a clever strategy of keeping low-confidence detections and using them to associate with tracks during occlusion, which improves tracking robustness.
* **Incorporate Jersey Number Recognition:** Adding an OCR model to read jersey numbers would provide an almost infallible feature for re-identification when numbers are visible.
* **Latency Optimization:** For real-time performance, the model inference could be optimized using tools like TensorRT and the entire pipeline could be parallelized.
